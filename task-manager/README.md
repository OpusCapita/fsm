## Intro
FSM Task(Work) manager is an extension to finite state machine. It manages
existing tasks (stateful full objects, e.g. invoice) within the lifecycle
specified in finite state machine (definition.

## Configuration
### Workflow schema with automatic transitions example:
```
{
  "name": "process",
  "initialState": "started",
  "finalStates": [
    "finished"
  ],
  "objectStateFieldName": "status",
  "transitions": [
    {
      "from": "started",
      "event": "register",
      "to": "registered",
      "actions": [
        {
          "name": "logAction"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "from": "registered",
      "event": "toAutoBranch",
      "to": "autoStepA",
      "actions": [
        {
          "name": "logAction"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "from": "autoStepA",
      "event": "autoEvent1",
      "to": "autoStepB",
      "actions": [
        {
          "name": "logAction"
        }
      ],
      "automatic": [
        {"name": "someAutoGuard"}
      ]
    },
    {
      "from": "autoStepB",
      "event": "autoFinish",
      "to": "finished",
      "actions": [
        {
          "name": "logAction"
        }
      ],
      "automatic": true
    }
  ]
}

```

_someAutoGuard_ - is a 'auto' guard, function that should exist in {conditions} parameter of _MachineDefinition_
constructor.

_Auto-conditions_ execution result (should be true or false) signal whether to execute or not transition automatically.
If you need the node to be automatic 'as is by default', use "automatic": true

### Configuring Task(process) Manager
```
  this.machine = new Machine({
    machineDefinition: new MachineDefinition({schema,actions,conditions}),
    context
  });

  this.processManager = new TaskManager({
    machine: this.processMachine,
    search: search,
    update: update
  });

  //function that return promise that is resolved with task list
  function search(searchParams) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      setTimeout(() => {
        resolve([{status: ''}, {status: ''}]);
      }, 500)
    })
  };

 //function that return promise that is resolved after object saving
 function update(object) {
   return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    //some hard-working persistent saving code
    resolve();
   })
 };
```

## Starting the process
After configuration there is only one thing is left behind - to start task list monitoring.
```
const timeout = 1000;
processManager.run(timeout);
```

_timeout_ argument indicates the frequency of calling _search_ action and checking for
available automatic event / sending events (in case found auto-transitions);

## Stopping the process
If the time has come to kill the process, you have to do the next:
```
processManager.stop();
```
This method return true/false in case of correct/incorrect process finish, correspondingly.

## Getting ongoing/stopped process statistic
Sometime you may need to get the process statistic (currently available values are: machine name,
start & end timestamps)

```
processManager.processCache
```

This field is an object with next signature:
{<timer_descriptor> : {
  <name>,
  <started>,
  <finished>
}}

TBD: increase process cache notation usability
TBD: add 1 by 1 event sending queue

## Sending event to object with TaskManager
You might need an ability to send event to an object with further saving.
If you configured TaskManager properly and it knows how to save objects, next two code snippets do the same:
```
//passed as constructor arg to TaskManager
const update = (object) => {
  <some async object update code>
  return Promise
};
machine.sendEvent({object, event, request}).then(({object}) => {
  return update(object);
})

----equals---

taskManager.sendEvent({object, event, request})
```

## Starting workflow with TaskManager
Also you might want to start the workflow with further object saving.
If you configured TaskManager properly and it knows how to save objects, next to code snippets do the same:
```
//passed as constructor arg to TaskManager
const update = (object) => {
  <some async object update code>
  return Promise
};
machine.start({object}).then(({object}) => {
  return update(object);
})

----equals---

taskManager.start({object})
```
